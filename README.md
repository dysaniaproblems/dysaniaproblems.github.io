## **Wake your fury and wait in hell**

 **A song made by Akihiko Narita and Casey Edwards, it plays during the start of Vergil's Mission**
 
 *It's at the bottom of the list since it doesn't hit hard than the other 4 in this list, there's a guitar tune that's present in "Bury the Light" (more on that later) which sounds amazing, but in my opinion, it doesn't really hit your soul like the other 4 louder ones*
 
 **Length** - 2 minutes and 30 seconds
 
 **Genre** - Metal, Rock (Soft)
 
 **Year of release** - Jan 21, 2021

## **Enjoy the taste of despair**

**A song made by Hiromitsu Maeba, it plays during the start of V's mission**

## **Devil Trigger**

** A song made by Casey Edwards and Ali Edwards**

*The top 3 in the list, the song reverbs through your soul and you can feel that* **MOTIVATION**, *but the top 2 and top 1 has more* **MOTIVATION** *than "Devil Trigger", and for that reason, I place it in a good top 3 spot*
