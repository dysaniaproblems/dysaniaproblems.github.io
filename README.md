## **Wake your fury and wait in hell**

 **A song made by Akihiko Narita and Casey Edwards, it plays during the start of Vergil's Mission**
 
 *It's at the bottom of the list since it doesn't hit hard than the other 4 in this list, there's a guitar tune that's present in "Bury the Light" (more on that later) which sounds amazing, but in my opinion, it doesn't really hit your soul like the other 4 louder ones*
 
 **Length** - 2 minutes and 30 seconds
 
 **Genre** - Metal, Rock (Soft)
 
 **Year of release** - Jan 21, 2021
